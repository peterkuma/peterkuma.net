abstract: '<p>One of the primary objectives of the New Zealand Earth System Model
  (NZESM) is to reduce shortwave radiation biases over the Southern Ocean, which are
  related to deficiencies in representation of clouds and aerosols in this region.
  This is a subject of active research with multiple hypotheses being tested including
  cloud microphysics, cloud-aerosol interaction, horizontal homogeneity and differences
  in frequency of cloud regimes related to different weather systems being examined.
  Comparison with observations is necessary for the identification and resolution
  of the deficiencies. Unfortunately, observations in the Southern Ocean are scarce,
  with satellites providing the most extensive spatial and temporal coverage, especially
  instruments such as MODIS and ISCCP and active instruments<br>

  such as radar and lidar on the CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites. However, these instruments
  lack the capability to observe low-level cloud when there is a higher-level overlapping
  cloud.</p>


  <p><br>

  We present a new multi-year dataset of shipborne and ground-based ceilometer, radar
  and aerosol observations in the Southern Ocean, which allows for cloud to be seen
  &lsquo;from below&rsquo; and assess the cloud-aerosol interaction. We also discuss
  the use the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator
  Package (COSP) to<br>

  compare the ceilometer measurements with NZESM simulations. The COSP simulator currently
  does not support ground-based lidars with a matching wavelength, but we have identified
  that the ACTSIM lidar simulator in COSP requires only a few modifications to support
  the analysis of ceilometer data. Using an instrument simulator such as COSP allows
  us to account for the limited view of the ceilometer and signal attenuation in the
  atmosphere. We therefore discuss future efforts and extending the capability of
  the COSP simulator.</p>'
