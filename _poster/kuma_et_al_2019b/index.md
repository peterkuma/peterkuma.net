abstract: <p>Atmospheric lidar measurements are a well-established tool for remote
  sensing of clouds. For over a decade, spaceborne lidar measurements produced by
  the CALIOP instrument on the CALIPSO satellite and CATS on the International Space
  Station have proven invaluable for model cloud evaluation in general circulation
  and numerical weather forecasting models. They have revealed the vertical structure
  of clouds, particularly in combination with radar instruments, which is impossible
  to obtain with passive remote sensing instruments. However, the measurements are
  limited by rapid attenuation of the lidar signal in thick clouds. Ground-based lidar
  measurements are becoming more common due to greater availability of instruments
  such as ceilometers installed on a wide scale globally. They can provide much needed
  lidar measurements of clouds &rdquo;from below&rdquo;, but processing of lidar data
  and model evaluation using this data is not well-developed compared to satellite
  measurements. We present an open source tool called the Automatic Lidar and Ceilometer
  Framework (ALCF) which implements common lidar processing steps such as resampling,
  noise removal, cloud detection, calculation of statistics, as well as model&mdash;observation
  intercomparison&nbsp;by bundling the COSP/ACTSIM lidar simulator and allowing it
  to produce &rdquo;curtain&rdquo; lidar pseudo-measurements from model output of
  various models (MERRA-2, AMPS, CMIP5) corresponding to ground-based and shipborne
  instruments (Vaisala CL31, CL51, Lufft CHM 15k, Sigma Space MiniMPL). These pseudo-measurements
  can be compared in an &rdquo;apples to apples&rdquo; comparison with observations.
  We hope this tool will enable ground-based lidars to be used more commonly for model
  evaluation and improvement efforts.</p>
