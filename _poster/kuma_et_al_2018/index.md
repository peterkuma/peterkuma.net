abstract: '<p>The Southern Ocean is characterised by sparse ground-based and in-situ
  atmospheric measurements. While satellite measurements provide continuous spatial
  and temporal coverage, they are generally not capable of observing low-level clouds
  and the cloud base, which are critical for accurately modelling radiative transfer.
  Results from general circulation models show significant biases in outgoing shortwave
  radiation in this region, believed to be related to deficiencies in representation
  of clouds, aerosols or their interaction. As part of the Cloud and Aerosol project
  of the New Zealand Deep South Challenge (DSC) we collected and analysed cloud measurements
  from multiple shipborne and ground-based deployments of several meteorological instruments:
  ceilometer, lidar, micro rain radar, radio soundings, aerosol sensors, sky cameras
  and UAV-borne sensors. With this combination of instruments we hope to advance understanding
  of cloud processes in this region, quantify model error compared to observations
  and contribute to the modelling effort of the DSC. Currently we have collected observations
  from a ground-based deployment on Macquarie Island and multiple voyages: Aurora
  Australis, R/V Tangaroa, HMNZS Wellington and R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer. By incorporating
  data from these and planned future deployments we intend to produce a Southern Ocean
  dataset of atmospheric measurements available for general use. This presentation
  will provide an overview of our progress and results.</p>'
