abstract: <p>Equilibrium and transient climate sensitivity (ECS and TCS) are some
  of the most fundamental properties characterising the future climate. Progress in
  estimating climate sensitivity over the last three decades has been hampered by
  a large climate model spread of ECS and TCS estimates, and more recently by a large
  increase in ECS predicted by several models in the latest generation of the Climate
  Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). Clouds have been identified as the major
  source of this uncertainty and the recent increase in estimated ECS. A &quot;too
  few, too bright&quot; model cloud problem has been found in several regions of the
  globe, including tropical latitudes and the Southern Ocean. Southern Ocean has also
  been a major focus of changes in model microphysics in an effort to simulate more
  realistic supercooled liquid clouds. Here, we focus on the too few, too bright problem
  in the Southern Ocean in CMIP6 models and its possible relation to climate sensitivity.
  We explore the possibility of applying new emergent constraints on climate sensitivity
  based on metrics of the too few, too bright problem. We use satellite and and ship-based
  observational datasets such as lidar and radiometer observations for constraining
  climate sensitivity and evaluation of clouds in this region across generations of
  CMIP models.</p>
