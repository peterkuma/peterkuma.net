abstract: '<p>The Subantarctic and the Southern Ocean are regions where there are
  sparse ground-based and in-situ cloud measurements. While satellite measurements
  provide continuous spatial and temporal coverage, they are generally not capable
  of observing low-level clouds and the cloud base, which are critical for understanding
  the radiative energy budget. Results from general circulation models show bias in
  the shortwave radiation in this region, related to representation of clouds. As
  part of the Cloud and Aerosol project of the New Zealand Deep South National Science
  Challenge (DSC) we aim to collect and analyse cloud measurements from shipborne
  and ground-based deployments of several meteorological instruments: a near-infrared
  ceilometer, a micro rain radar and radio soundings. With this combination of multiple
  instruments we hope to advance the understanding of cloud processes in this region,
  quantify model errors compared to observations and contribute to the modelling effort
  of the DSC. Currently we have collected observations from a ground-based deployment
  on the Macquarie Island and multiple ship deployments: Aurora Australis, RV Tangaroa,
  HMNZS Wellington and R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer. By incorporating data from these and
  planned future deployments we intend to compile and maintain a Southern Ocean cloud
  dataset which will be available for&nbsp; general use. This presentation will provide
  an overview of our current progress and preliminary results.</p>'
