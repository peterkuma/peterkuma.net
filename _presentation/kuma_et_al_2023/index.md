abstract: <p>Contemporary general circulation models (GCMs) and Earth system models
  (ESMs) are developed by a large number of modeling groups globally. They use a wide
  range of representations of physical processes, allowing for structural (code) uncertainty
  to be partially quantified with multi-model ensembles (MMEs). Many models in the
  MMEs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) have a common development
  history due to sharing of code and schemes. This makes their projections statistically
  dependent and introduces biases in MME statistics. Previous research has focused
  on model output and code dependence, and model code genealogy of CMIP models has
  not been fully analyzed. We present a full reconstruction of CMIP3, CMIP5 and CMIP6
  code genealogy of 167 atmospheric models, GCMs, and ESMs (of which 114 participated
  in CMIP) based on the available literature, with a focus on the atmospheric component
  and atmospheric physics. We identify 12 main model families. We propose family and
  code weighting methods designed to reduce the effect of model structural dependence
  in MMEs. We analyze weighted effective climate sensitivity (ECS), climate feedbacks,
  forcing, and global mean near-surface air temperature, and how they differ by model
  family. Models in the same family often have similar climate properties. We show
  that weighting can partially reconcile differences in ECS and cloud feedbacks between
  CMIP5 and CMIP6. The results can help in understanding structural dependence between
  CMIP models, and the proposed code and family weighting methods can be used in MME
  assessments to ameliorate model structural sampling biases.</p>
