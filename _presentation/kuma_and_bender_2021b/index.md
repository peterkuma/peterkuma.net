abstract: <p>We develop a deep convolutional neural network for determination of cloud
  types in low-resolution daily mean top-of-atmosphere shortwave and longwave radiation
  images, corresponding to the classical cloud types recorded by human observers in
  the Global Telecommunication System. We train this network on the CERES top of atmosphere
  radiation dataset, and apply this network on the CMIP6 abrupt-4xCO2 model output
  to determine long-term change in cloud type occurrence in these models with increasing
  CO2 concentration. We contrast these results with corresponding cloud type change
  in historical satellite measurements. The proposed neural network approach is broadly
  applicable for model, reanalysis and satellite imagery evaluation because it does
  not require high resolution and corresponds to the cloud types commonly recorded
  at weather stations worldwide.</p>
