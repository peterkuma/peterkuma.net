abstract: <p>Current general circulation models are affected by biases in simulated
  clouds in the Southern Ocean (SO) which are despite some recent progress are still
  too large, resulting in biases in shortwave and longwave radiative transfer. These
  biases are also present in the HadGEM3 model, a UK Met Office model which has been
  a focus of development in the Deep South National Science Challenge with the aim
  to more accurately project future climate in New Zealand. The amount of cloud has
  more ice phase than expected. Satellite observations have been used extensively
  to study this problem, but the predominantly low level cloud in the SO cannot be
  reliably observed from space due to the prevalence of overlapping cloud and other
  limitations such as ground clutter in active instruments. We use observational data
  from a number of SO voyages to assess clouds in HadGEM3, and contrast it with the
  MERRA-2 reanalysis, which provides very different cloud phase and cloud occurrence
  results in the SO. We use ceilometer observations collected on voyages to assess
  cloud vertical distribution, mini micropulse lidar observations to assess cloud
  phase and radiosonde observations to assess tropospheric stability and humidity
  profiles. The ceilometer observations cannot be compared directly with the model
  due to attenuation of the lidar beam in thick cloud, and we use a ceilometer simulator
  developed for this project for a like-for-like comparison. We also apply this evaluation
  to a number of experimental HadGEM3 runs produced with different choices of cloud
  scheme parameters in order to fix the SO cloud bias.</p>
