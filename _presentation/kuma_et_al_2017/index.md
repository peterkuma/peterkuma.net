abstract: '<p>One of the primary objectives of the New Zealand Earth System Model
  (NZESM) is to reduce shortwave radiation biases over the Southern Ocean, which are
  related to deficiencies in representation of clouds and aerosols in this region.
  This is a subject of active research with multiple hypotheses being tested including
  cloud microphysics, cloud&ndash;aerosol interaction, horizontal homogeneity and
  differences in the frequency of cloud regimes related to different weather systems
  being examined. Comparison with observations is necessary for the identification
  and resolution of these deficiencies. Unfortunately, observations in the Southern
  Ocean are scarce, with satellites providing the most extensive spatial and temporal
  coverage, especially instruments such as MODIS and ISCCP and active instruments
  such as radar and lidar (laser lidar) on the CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites. However,
  these instruments lack the capability to observe low-level cloud when there is a
  higher-level overlapping cloud.</p>


  <p>We present a multi-year dataset of shipborne and ground-based ceilometer, radar
  and aerosol observations in the Southern Ocean, which allows for cloud to be seen
  &lsquo;from below&rsquo;. In particular, we discuss the use the Cloud Feedback Model
  Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP) to compare
  the ceilometer measurements with NZESM simulations. The COSP simulator currently
  does not support ground-based lidars with a matching wavelength, but the ACTSIM
  lidar simulator in COSP requires only a few modifications to support the analysis
  of ceilometer data. Using an instrument simulator such as COSP allows us to account
  for the limited view of the ceilometer and signal attenuation in the atmosphere.</p>


  <p>We apply the newly developed ceilometer simulator to the NZESM atmospheric state
  output in the regions of the Southern Ocean where shipborne or ground-based observations
  are available, and compare the resulting backscatter distribution and algorithmically
  derived products such as cloud base between the model and observations.</p>'
